# Brain-Tumor-classfication-using-CNN


This project presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model designed for the classification of brain tumors into four categories: Glioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, and No Tumor. The model processes grayscale medical images to accurately identify and differentiate between these tumor types, providing a valuable tool for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

Key Features
High Accuracy: The CNN model is trained to deliver precise classifications, helping in the early detection of brain tumors.
Four-Class Classification: The model categorizes images into Glioma, Pituitary Tumor, Meningioma, and No Tumor.
Grayscale Image Processing: Efficiently handles grayscale MRI images to perform classification.
Clinical Impact: Aims to support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, improving patient outcomes through reliable and fast diagnostics.
Dataset
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing labeled MRI images corresponding to the four tumor classes. The dataset ensures diversity in imaging scenarios, allowing the model to generalize well in different clinical environments.

Usage
To use the model for brain tumor classification, follow the instructions provided in the Installation and Usage sections. The model can be integrated into various healthcare applications for real-time analysis and diagnosis.

Future Enhancements
Expansion to include additional tumor types.
Integration with FPGA for accelerated inference in real-time applications.
Further optimization of the model for even higher accuracy and efficiency.
